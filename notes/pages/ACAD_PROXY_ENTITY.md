- The [[ProxyGraphic]] **is not stored** in subclass [[AcDbEntity]] as in every other entity
- The [[ProxyGraphic]] is stored in subclass [[AcDbProxyEntity]]
- There are multiple binary chunks with group code 310 and a preceeding lenght tag
- Each chunk has a different group code for the length tag
- The assumption is:
	- The [[ProxyGraphic]] chunk has a group code of 92 or 160 for the length tag - dependent on the DXF version
	- 92 for DXF2010 and earlier
	- 160 for DXF R2013 and later
- This assumption is **wrong**
	- issue [#978](https://github.com/mozman/ezdxf/issues/978)
	- a DXF R2010 file with group code 160 for the length tag
- The solution is to try both group codes and the first binary chunk will be taken as [[ProxyGraphic]]
