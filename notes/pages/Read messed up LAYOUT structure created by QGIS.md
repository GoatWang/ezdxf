- {{issue 997}}
- The recovering is done by the [[recover]] module.
- The [[LAYOUT]] entities in the OBJECTS sections reference non existing [[BLOCK_RECORD]] entities by the DXF atttribute `block_record_handle` (group code 330 in the `AcDbLayout` section)
- The reqired block definitions for these layouts do exist, but:
	- The `owner` handle (group code 330) of the [[BLOCK]] entities  do reference the correct [[BLOCK_RECORD]] entities
	- The DXF attribute `layout` (group code 340) of the [[BLOCK_RECORD]] **does not** reference the associated [[LAYOUT]] entity
	- So there is no direct connection between [[Layout]] and [[BLOCK_RECORD]] or [[BLOCK]]
- Recovering the modelspace is easy:
	- connect the [[LAYOUT]] entity with name `Model` to the [[BLOCK]] and [[BLOCK_RECORD]] `*Model_Space`
- Recovering the paperspace layouts is more tricky
	- for each [[LAYOUT]] entity that has an invalid or non-existent [[BLOCK_RECORD]] reference, find a paperspace [[BLOCK]] (starting with `*Paper_Space`) that is not assigned to a [[LAYOUT]] and link both structures.
	- that connects the sturctures in the order of appearance.
	- additional cases to take into account:
		- no [[BLOCK]] definition for a [[LAYOUT]]
		- no [[BLOCK_RECORD]] for a [[LAYOUT]]
